      <h1>Is the academic system encouraging too many unnecessary publications?</h1>
      <h2>What can be done?</h2>

      <time datetime="11-27-2021">NOV 27, 2021</time>

      <p>In the academic world, there are so many <em>published papers</em>. There are about two million articles published each year. One professor in a university may have over 50 publications already. One topic/issue may have over 1000 publications about it. Likewise, one data may be used 10000 times. Are professors just publishing for personal interests or are they contributing to knowledge? Are all the two million articles published each year contributing answers/solutions to humanity's questions/problems?</p>
      <p>This is not to say I am against academic papers. No one can dispute the value of contributing to knowledge and solving problems with data. Most of the things we know, most of the solutions we have, and most of the inventions we today have some foundations in the papers that have been published.</p>

      <h3>ONE OF MY CONCERNS</h3>
      <p>One concern is that professors prioritize publishing academic papers over impacting knowledge and guiding students to do research. The University system also ties the promotion of a professor to the number of academic papers the professor has published. This means professors feel compelled to do everything within their power to publish more papers in order to get bigger promotions.</p>
      <p>When there are too many articles published in a year, the result is a lot of low-quality publications in the system! Academic journals are now bombarded with all these below-par papers. Many of these journals are battling with a lot of backlogs. As Economists, is this not a waste of resources? Is the trade-off between the resources spent on some of these papers and the benefits worth it? Is there a better way out?</p>

      <h1>Can Elon Musk's $6B end world hunger?</h1>
      <time datetime="11-28-2021">NOV 28, 2021</time>
      <p>According to U.N. World Food Program (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley, billionaires such as Musk could donate "$6 billion to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don't reach them."</p>

      <p>Elon Musk responded that he is willing to sell $6B of Tesla stock right now and make a contribution to helping the 42 million people. However, he insisted that the WTP must explain precisely how that money will be used to do that. Beasley subsequently offered to meet with Musk to further discuss the topic.</p>

      <p>Economics is the study of scarcity with optimization being one of the most important aspects of economic analysis. This suggests to me that the main issue with world hunger is the scarcity of resources and technology rather than lack of money. If there was no scarcity, hunger would not be a topic of discussion. It is also true that money can buy food, but this is when the resources are available on the market.</p>

      <p>Here are my questions:</p>

      <li>
        <ol>
          Will Musk really sell his Tesla stock?
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Can $6B make a significant contribution to ending/reducing world hunger?
        </ol>
        <ol>
          If made, how should the contribution be used?
        </ol>
      </li>
